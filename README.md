# Interview Exercise

## Intro

This exercise is a pair-programming session with you leading and us here to support you.

Please run through the tasks below and be as vocal as you can during this 30 minute session. Don't worry about getting through all of the tasks or how long you spend on each. The tasks are there to guide you and prompt conversation, so that we can get a feel for how you solve problems and think about code. 

Feel free to ask questions or Google things at any point.

The documentation for the included `node-fetch` library can be found at https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repo, install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn`.
    - Alternatively, you can work on the project online using Stackblitz: https://stackblitz.com/github/senseyeio/interview-js.

2. Open `src/main.js`. The goal is to make all of the tests pass.
    - The tasks are specified as comments in `src/main.js`.
    - The expected test output is in `src/main.spec.js`.

3. Run the tests with `npm test` or `yarn test`.
    - You can run individual tests with `npm run task1`, `npm run task2` etc... (or `yarn task1`, `yarn task2` etc...)
